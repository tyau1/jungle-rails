### Getting started

1. Start with routes, admin/sales
   - can easily be tested
   IE. localhost://0.0.0admin/sales

2. Add sales controller

3.  use raise to see errors
    - raise adds errors to the browser so you can easily see it (dont have to see it in console.)
   - Add.inspect to see values
   - raise @product.inspect
